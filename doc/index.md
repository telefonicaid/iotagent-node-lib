# Welcome to the FIWARE IoT Agent Framework

This project aims to provide a Node.js module to enable IoT Agent developers to build custom agents for their devices that can
easily connect to NGSI Context Brokers (such as [Orion](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) ). 

An IoT Agent is a component that lets groups of devices send their data to and be managed from a FIWARE NGSI Context
Broker using their own native protocols. IoT Agents should also be able to deal with security aspects of the Fiware
platform (authentication and authorization of the channel) and provide other common services to the device programmer.

Github's [README.md](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib/blob/master/README.md) provides a good documentation summary.
The [User Manual](usermanual.md) and the [Admin Guide](installationguide.md) cover more advanced topics.
