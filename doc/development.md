### Contributions

All contributions to this project are welcome. Developers planning to contribute should follow the
[Contribution Guidelines](Contribution.md)

### Project build

The project is managed using npm.

For a list of available task, type

```bash
npm run
```

The following sections show the available options in detail.

### Environment requirements

A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) 3.2+ instance is required to run tests. You can deploy one by using the commodity
`docker-compose-dev.yml`:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

To run docker compose you will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Testing

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) Test Runner + [Should.js](https://shouldjs.github.io/) Assertion Library.

The test environment is preconfigured to run BDD testing style.

Module mocking during testing can be done with [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire)

To run tests, type

```bash
npm test
```

There are additional targets starting with `test:` prefix to run specific test subsets isolatedly. For instance, the
`test:expressions` target runs the subset of tests related with expression language feature:

```bash
npm run test:expressions
```

### Debug Test

To debug the code while running run tests, type

```bash
npm run test:debug
```

In the console the link to the debugger will be provided. You can connect to it via Chrome, for example, by opening the
following url: `chrome://inspect`.

Additional debug clients are listed on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).

### Coding guidelines

ESLint

Uses the provided `.eslintrc.json` flag file. To check source code style, type

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Continuous testing

Support for continuous testing by modifying a src file or a test. For continuous testing, type

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

If you want to continuously check also source code style, use instead:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Code Coverage

Istanbul

Analyze the code coverage of your tests.

To generate an HTML coverage report under `site/coverage/` and to print out a summary, type

```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
npm run test:coverage
```

### Clean

Removes `node_modules` and `coverage` folders, and `package-lock.json` file so that a fresh copy of the project is
restored.

```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
npm run clean
```

### Documentation Markdown validation

Checks the Markdown documentation for consistency

```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
npm run lint:md
```

### Documentation Spell-checking

Uses the provided `.textlintrc` flag file. To check the Markdown documentation for spelling and grammar errors, dead
links & etc.

```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
npm run lint:text
```

### Clean

Removes `node_modules` and `coverage` folders, and `package-lock.json` file so that a fresh copy of the project is
restored.

```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
npm run clean
```

### Prettify Code

Runs the [prettier](https://prettier.io) code formatter to ensure consistent code style (whitespacing, parameter
placement and breakup of long lines etc.) within the codebase.

```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
npm run prettier
```

To ensure consistent Markdown formatting run the following:

```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
npm run prettier:text
```

# DB Models (from API document)

## Service group model

## Data mapping plugins

The IoT Agent Library provides a plugin mechanism in order to facilitate reusing code that makes small transformations
on incoming data (both from the device and from the context consumers). This mechanism is based in the use of
middlewares, i.e.: small pieces of code that receive and return an `entity`, making as many changes as they need, but
taking care of returning a valid entity, that can be used as the input for other middlewares; this way, all those pieces
of code can be chained together in order to make all the needed transformations in the target entity.

There are two kinds of middlewares: updateContext middlewares and queryContext middlewares. The updateContext
middlewares are applied before the information is sent to the Context Broker, modifiying the entity before it is sent to
Orion. The queryContext middlewares are applied on the received data, whenever the IoT Agent queries the Context Broker
for information. I.e.: both middlewares will be automatically applied whenever the `update()` or `query()` functions are
called in the library.

All the middlewares have the opportunity to break the chain of middleware applications by calling the `callback()` with
an error object (the usual convention). If any of the updateContext middlewares raise an error, no request will be sent
to the Context Broker. On the other hand, the queryContext request is always performed, but the call to the `query()`
function will end up in an error if any of the queryContext middlewares report an error.

### Development

All the middlewares have the same signature:

```javascript
function middlewareName(entity, typeInformation, callback) {}
```

The arguments for any middleware are the NGSI data over which it can operate:

-   An updateContext payload in the case of an updateContext middleware and a queryContext payload otherwise;
-   a typeInformation object containing all the information about the device stored during registration.
-   and the customary `callback` parameter, with the usual meaning. It's really important for the library user to call
    this callback, as failing to do so may hang the IoT Agent completely. The callback must be called with the an
    optional error in the first argument and the same arguments received (potentially modified) as the following.

In order to manage the middlewares to the system, the following functions can be used:

-   `addUpdateMiddleware`: adds an updateContext middleware to the stack of middlewares. All the middlewares will be
    applied to every call to the `update()` function. The final payload of the updateContext request will be the result
    of applying all this middlewares in the order they have been defined.

-   `addQueryMiddleware`: adds a queryContext middleware to the stack of middlewares. All the middlewares will be
    applied to every call to the `query()` function.

-   `resetMiddlewares`: remove all the middlewares from the system.

Usually, the full list of middlewares an IoT Agent will use would be added in the IoTAgent start sequence, so they
should not change a lot during the IoT lifetime.

### Provided plugins

The library provides some plugins out of the box, in the `dataPlugins` collection. In order to load any of them, just
use the `addQueryMiddleware` and `addUpdateMiddleware` functions with the selected plugin, as in the example:

```javascript
var iotaLib = require('iotagent-node-lib');

iotaLib.addUpdateMiddleware(iotaLib.dataPlugins.compressTimestamp.update);
iotaLib.addQueryMiddleware(iotaLib.dataPlugins.compressTimestamp.query);
```
