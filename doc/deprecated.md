# Deprecated functionality

Deprecated features are features that iotagent-node-lib stills support but that are not maintained or evolved any
longer. In particular:

-   Bugs or issues related with deprecated features and not affecting any other feature are not addressed (they are
    closed in github.com as soon as they are spotted).
-   Documentation on deprecated features is removed from the repository documentation. Documentation is still available
    in the documentation set associated to older versions (in the repository release branches).
-   Deprecated functionality is eventually removed from iotagent-node-lib. Thus you are strongly encouraged to change
    your implementations using iotagent-node-lib in order not rely on deprecated functionality.

A list of deprecated features and the version in which they were deprecated follows:

-   Support to NGSI v1 (finally removed in 2.18.0)
-   Support to Node.js v4 in iotagent-node-lib 2.8.1 (finally removed in 2.9.0)
-   Support to Node.js v6 in iotagent-node-lib 2.9.0 (finally removed in 2.10.0)
-   Support to Node.js v8 in iotagent-node-lib 2.12.0 (finally removed in 2.13.0)
-   Support to Node.js v10 in iotagent-node-lib 2.15.0 (finally removed in 2.16.0)
-   Support to Node.js v12 in iotagent-node-lib 2.24.0 (finally removed in 2.25.0)
-   Support to NGSI-LD v1.3 in iotagent-node-lib 2.25.0 (finally removed in 2.26.0)
-   Support groups (provision) statically defined by configuration
-   Support to in-memory registry (i.e.`deviceRegistry.type=memory`)
-   eventType configuration (finally removed in 3.0.0)
-   Support to legacy expressions (finally removed in 3.2.0)
-   Bidirectinal pluging (finally removed in 3.4.0)
-   appendMode configuration (`IOTA_APPEND_MODE` env var) (finally removed in 3.4.0)
-   `config.stats` section, and push-mode statistics.

The use of Node.js v14 is highly recommended.

## Using old iotagent-node-lib versions

Although you are encouraged to use always the newest iotagent-node-lib version, take into account the following
information in the case you want to use old versions:

-   Code corresponding to old releases is available at the
    [iotagent-node-lib GitHub repository](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib). Each release number (e.g.
    2.7.0 ) has associated the following: _ A tag, e.g. `2.7.0`. It points to the base version. _ A release branch,
    `release/2.7.0`. The HEAD of this branch usually matches the aforementioned tag. However, if some hotfixes were
    developed on the base version, this branch contains such hotfixes.
-   Documentation corresponding to old versions can be found at
    [readthedocs.io](https://iotagent-node-lib.readthedocs.io). Use the panel in the right bottom corner to navigate to
    the right version.

The following table provides information about the last iotagent-node-lib version supporting currently removed features:
