### Secured access to the Context Broker

For access to instances of the Context Broker secured with a
[PEP Proxy](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion-pep), an authentication mechanism based in Keystone Trust
tokens is provided. A trust token is a way of Keystone to allow an user delegates a role to another user for a
subservice. It is a long-term token that can be issued by any user to give another user permissions to impersonate him
with a given role in a given project (subservice). Such impersonation itself is in turn based on a short-term access
token.

For the authentication mechanisms to work, the `authentication` attribute in the configuration has to be fully
configured, and the `authentication.enabled` subattribute should have the value `true`.

When the administrator of a service is configuring a set of devices or device types in the IoT Agent to use a secured
Context Broker, he should follow this steps:

-   First, a Trust Token ID should be requested to Keystone, using the service administrator credentials, the role ID
    and the IoT Agent User ID. The Trust token can be retrieved using the following request (shown as a curl command):

```bash
curl http://${KEYSTONE_HOST}/v3/OS-TRUST/trusts \
    -s \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '
{
    "trust": {
        "impersonation": false,
        "project_id": "'$SUBSERVICE_ID'",
        "roles": [
            {"id": "'$ID_ROLE'"
            }
        ],
        "trustee_user_id": "'$ID_IOTAGENT_USER'",
        "trustor_user_id": "'$ID_ADM1'"
    }
}'
```

-   Every device or type of devices configured to use a secured Context Broker must be provided with a Trust Token ID in
    its configuration.
-   Before any request is sent to a secured Context Broker, the IoT Agent uses the Trust Token ID to generate a
    temporary access token, that is attached to the request (in the `X-Auth-token` header) (using Keystone API
    https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3-ext/#consuming-a-trust).

Apart from the generation of the trust, the use of secured Context Brokers should be transparent to the user of the IoT
Agent.

### NGSI-LD `GeoProperty` support

For NGSI-LD only, the defined `type` of any GeoJSON attribute can be any set using any of the standard NGSI-v2 GeoJSON
types - (e.g. `geo:json`, `geo:point`). NGSI-LD formats such as `GeoProperty`, `Point` and `LineString` are also
accepted `type` values. If the latitude and longitude are received as separate measures, the JEXL or legacy
[expression language](expressionLanguage.md) can be used to concatenate them into GeoJSON objects an array of tuples or
a string as shown

#### Legacy - encode as String

```json
{
    "entity_type": "GPS",
    "resource":    "/iot/d",
    "protocol":    "PDI-IoTA-JSON",
..etc
    "attributes": [
        {
            "name": "location",
            "type": "geo:json",
            "expression": "${@lng}, ${@lat}"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### JEXL - encode as GeoJSON

```json
{
    "entity_type": "GPS",
    "resource":    "/iot/d",
    "protocol":    "PDI-IoTA-JSON",
    "expressionLanguage": "jexl",
..etc
    "attributes": [
        {
            "name": "location",
            "type": "geo:json",
            "expression": "{coordinates: [longitude,latitude], type: 'Point'}"
        }
    ]
}
```

JEXL can be used to create GeoJSON objects directly. The Legacy expression language does not support GeoJSON. However,
there is a workaround specifically for NGSI-LD Entities which always require `location` to be encoded as GeoJSON. For
`attributes` and `static_attributes` which need to be formatted as GeoJSON values, three separate input formats are
currently accepted. Provided the `type` is provisioned correctly, the `value` may be defined using any of the following
formats:

-   a comma delimited string

```json
{
    "name": "location",
    "value": "23, 12.5"
}
```

-   an array of numbers

```json
{
    "name": "location",
    "value": [23, 12.5]
}
```

-   an fully formatted GeoJSON object

```json
{
    "name": "location",
    "value": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [23, 12.5]
    }
}
```

### Metadata support

Both `attributes` and `static_attributes` may be supplied with metadata when provisioning an IoT Agent, so that the
units of measurement can be placed into the resultant entity.

e.g.:

```json
{
     "entity_type": "Lamp",
     "resource":    "/iot/d",
     "protocol":    "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
..etc
     "commands": [
        {"name": "on","type": "command"},
        {"name": "off","type": "command"}
     ],
     "attributes": [
        {"object_id": "s", "name": "state", "type":"Text"},
        {"object_id": "l", "name": "luminosity", "type":"Integer",
          "metadata":{
              "unitCode":{"type": "Text", "value" :"CAL"}
          }
        }
     ],
     "static_attributes": [
          {"name": "category", "type":"Text", "value": ["actuator","sensor"]},
          {"name": "controlledProperty", "type": "Text", "value": ["light"],
            "metadata":{
              "includes":{"type": "Text", "value" :["state", "luminosity"]},
              "alias":{"type": "Text", "value" :"lamp"}
            }
          },
     ]
   }
```

#### NGSI-LD data and metadata considerations

When provisioning devices for an NGSI-LD Context Broker, `type` values should typically correspond to one of the
following:

-   `Property`, `Relationship`, `Geoproperty`
-   Native JSON types (e.g. `String`, `Boolean`, `Float` , `Integer` `Number`)
-   Temporal Properties (e.g. `Datetime`, `Date` , `Time`)
-   GeoJSON types (e.g `Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`, `MultiLineString`, `MultiPolygon`)

Most NGSI-LD attributes are sent to the Context Broker as _properties_. If a GeoJSON type or native JSON type is
defined, the data will be converted to the appropriate type. Temporal properties should always be expressed in UTC,
using ISO 8601. This ISO 8601 conversion is applied automatically for the `observedAt` _property-of-a-property_ metadata
where present.

Data for any attribute defined as a _relationship_ must be a valid URN.

Note that when the `unitCode` metadata attribute is supplied in the provisioning data under NGSI-LD, the standard
`unitCode` _property-of-a-property_ `String` attribute is created.

Other unrecognised `type` attributes will be passed as NGSI-LD data using the following JSON-LD format:

```json
    "<property_name>": {
       "type" : "Property",
       "value": {
          "@type":  "<property_type>",
          "@value":  { string or object}
      }
    }
```

`null` values will be passed in the following format:

```json
     "<property_name>": {
       "type" : "Property",
       "value": {
          "@type":  "Intangible",
          "@value":  null
      }
    }
```

### NGSI-LD Linked Data support

`static_attributes` may be supplied with an additional `link` data element when provisioning an IoT Agent to ensure that
active attributes from the provisioned IoT Device may be maintained in parallel with a linked data entity . Take for
example a temperature gauge placed within a building. The **Device** data model literally represents the IoT device
itself, but the `temperature` attribute also needs to be shared with the **Building** entity

A `link` between them can be provisioned as shown:

e.g.:

```json
{
     "entity_type": "Device",
     "resource":    "/iot/d",
     "protocol":    "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
..etc
     "attributes": [
        {"object_id": "l", "name": "temperature", "type":"Float",
          "metadata":{
              "unitCode":{"type": "Text", "value" :"CEL"}
          }
        }
     ],
     "static_attributes": [
        {
          "name": "controlledAsset",
          "type": "Relationship",
          "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:001",
          "link": {
             "attributes": ["temperature"],
             "name": "providedBy",
             "type": "Building"
          }
        }
     ]
  }
```

Whenever a `temperature` measure is received **Device** is updated, and entity `urn:ngsi-ld:Building:001` is also
updated as shown:

```json
"temperature": {
    "type": "Property",
    "value": 27.6,
    "unitCode": "CEL",
    "providedBy": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "object": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:thermometer1"
    }
}
```

### Autoprovision configuration (autoprovision)

By default, when a measure arrives to the IoTAgent, if the `device_id` does not match with an existing one, then, the
IoTA creates a new device and a new entity according to the group config. Defining the field `autoprovision` to `false`
when provisioning the device group, the IoTA to reject the measure at the southbound, allowing only to persist the data
to devices that are already provisioned. It makes no sense to use this field in device provisioning since it is intended
to avoid provisioning devices (and for it to be effective, it would have to be provisional).

### Explicitly defined attributes (explicitAttrs)

If a given measure element (object_id) is not defined in the mappings of the device or group provision, the measure is
stored in the Context Broker by adding a new attribute to the entity with the same name of the undefined measure
element. By adding the field `explicitAttrs` with `true` value to device or group provision, the IoTAgent rejects the
measure elements that are not defined in the mappings of device or group provision, persisting only the one defined in
the mappings of the provision. If `explicitAttrs` is provided both at device and group level, the device level takes
precedence. Additionally `explicitAttrs` can be used to define which meassures defined in JSON/JEXL array will be
propagated to NGSI interface.

The different possibilities are summarized below:

Case 1 (default):

```
"explicitAttrs": false
```

every measure will be propagated to NGSI interface.

Case 2:

```
"explicitAttrs": true
```

just measures defined in active, static (plus conditionally TimeInstant) will be propagated to NGSI interface.

Case 3:

```
"explicitAttrs": "['attr1','atrr2']"
```

just measures defined in the array will be will be propagated to NGSI interface (note that in this case the value of
`explicitAttrs` is not a JSON but a string that looks likes a JSON).

Case 4:

```
"explicitAtttr": "<JEXL expression resulting in bool or array>"
```

depending on the JEXL expression evaluation:

-   If it evaluates to `true` every measure will be propagated to NGSI interface (as in case 1)
-   If it evaluates to `false` just measures defined in active, static (plus conditionally TimeInstant) will be
    propagated to NGSI interface (as in case 2)
-   If it evaluates to an array just measures defined in the array will be will be propagated to NGSI interface (as in
    case 3)

### Configuring operation to persist the data in Context Broker (appendMode)

This is a flag that can be enabled by activating the parameter `appendMode` in the configuration file or by using the
`IOTA_APPEND_MODE` environment variable (more info
[here](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib/blob/master/doc/installationguide.md)). If this flag is
activated, the update requests to the Context Broker will be performed always with APPEND type, instead of the default
UPDATE. This have implications in the use of attributes with Context Providers, so this flag should be used with care.

### Data mapping plugins

The IoT Agent Library provides a plugin mechanism in order to facilitate reusing code that makes small transformations
on incoming data (both from the device and from the context consumers). This mechanism is based in the use of
middlewares, i.e.: small pieces of code that receive and return an `entity`, making as many changes as they need, but
taking care of returning a valid entity, that can be used as the input for other middlewares; this way, all those pieces
of code can be chained together in order to make all the needed transformations in the target entity.

There are two kinds of middlewares: updateContext middlewares and queryContext middlewares. The updateContext
middlewares are applied before the information is sent to the Context Broker, modifiying the entity before it is sent to
Orion. The queryContext middlewares are applied on the received data, whenever the IoT Agent queries the Context Broker
for information. I.e.: both middlewares will be automatically applied whenever the `update()` or `query()` functions are
called in the library.

All the middlewares have the opportunity to break the chain of middleware applications by calling the `callback()` with
an error object (the usual convention). If any of the updateContext middlewares raise an error, no request will be sent
to the Context Broker. On the other hand, the queryContext request is always performed, but the call to the `query()`
function will end up in an error if any of the queryContext middlewares report an error.

#### Development

All the middlewares have the same signature:

```javascript
function middlewareName(entity, typeInformation, callback) {}
```

The arguments for any middleware are the NGSI data over which it can operate:

-   An updateContext payload in the case of an updateContext middleware and a queryContext payload otherwise;
-   a typeInformation object containing all the information about the device stored during registration.
-   and the customary `callback` parameter, with the usual meaning. It's really important for the library user to call
    this callback, as failing to do so may hang the IoT Agent completely. The callback must be called with the an
    optional error in the first argument and the same arguments received (potentially modified) as the following.

In order to manage the middlewares to the system, the following functions can be used:

-   `addUpdateMiddleware`: adds an updateContext middleware to the stack of middlewares. All the middlewares will be
    applied to every call to the `update()` function. The final payload of the updateContext request will be the result
    of applying all this middlewares in the order they have been defined.

-   `addQueryMiddleware`: adds a queryContext middleware to the stack of middlewares. All the middlewares will be
    applied to every call to the `query()` function.

-   `resetMiddlewares`: remove all the middlewares from the system.

Usually, the full list of middlewares an IoT Agent will use would be added in the IoTAgent start sequence, so they
should not change a lot during the IoT lifetime.

#### Provided plugins

The library provides some plugins out of the box, in the `dataPlugins` collection. In order to load any of them, just
use the `addQueryMiddleware` and `addUpdateMiddleware` functions with the selected plugin, as in the example:

```javascript
var iotaLib = require('iotagent-node-lib');

iotaLib.addUpdateMiddleware(iotaLib.dataPlugins.compressTimestamp.update);
iotaLib.addQueryMiddleware(iotaLib.dataPlugins.compressTimestamp.query);
```

##### Timestamp Compression plugin (compressTimestamp)

This plugins change all the timestamp attributes found in the entity, and all the timestamp metadata found in any
attribute, from the basic complete calendar timestamp of the ISO8601 (e.g.: 20071103T131805) to the extended complete
calendar timestamp (e.g.: +002007-11-03T13:18). The middleware expects to receive the basic format in updates and return
it in queries (and viceversa, receive the extended one in queries and return it in updates).

##### Attribute Alias plugin (attributeAlias)

In the Device provision, an ID can be specified for each attribute, along with its name. The ID can be used then as the
left part of a mapping from attribute names in the south bound to attribute names in the North Bound. If the ID and name
attributes are used in this way, this plugin makes the translation from one to the other automatically.

##### Event plugin (addEvents)

This plugin allows for the creation of Event attributes, i.e.: attributes whose value will be the timestamp of its
inclusion in the system, regardless of the value they carried in the Southbound API. If this plugin is active, all the
events in the IoT Agent with the configured type name will be marked as events. The event name can be configured in the
`config.eventType` attribute.

##### Timestamp Processing Plugin (timestampProcess)

This plugin processes the entity attributes looking for a `TimeInstant` attribute. If one is found, for NGSIv2, the
plugin adds a `TimeInstant` attribute as metadata for every other attribute in the same request. With NGSI-LD, the
Standard `observedAt` property-of-a-property is used instead.

##### Expression Translation plugin (expressionTransformation)

This plugin allows the devices and configurations that have defined expressions to generate their values from those
expressions and the reported measure information.

For further information on how the expressions work, refer to the
[Expression Language Reference](expressionLanguage.md).

##### Multientity plugin (multiEntity)

Allows the devices provisioned in the IoTAgent to map their attributes to more than one entity, declaring the target
entity through the Configuration or Device provisioning APIs.

```json
{
    "devices": [
        {
            "protocol": "IoTA-UL",
            "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:contador12",
            "entity_type": "multientity",
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "object_id": "cont1",
                    "name": "vol",
                    "type": "Text",
                    "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:WaterMeterSoria01",
                    "entity_type": "WaterMeter"
                },
                {
                    "object_id": "cont2",
                    "name": "vol",
                    "type": "Text",
                    "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:WaterMeterSoria02",
                    "entity_type": "WaterMeter"
                },
                {
                    "object_id": "cont3",
                    "name": "vol",
                    "type": "Text",
                    "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:WaterMeterSoria03",
                    "entity_type": "WaterMeter"
                }
            ],
            "device_id": "contador12"
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Bidirectionality plugin (bidirectional)

This plugin allows the devices with composite values an expression to update the original values in the devices when the
composite expressions are updated in the Context Broker. This behavior is achieved through the use of subscriptions.

IoTAs using this plugins should also define a notification handler to handle incoming values. This handler will be
intercepted by the plugin, so the mapped values are included in the updated notification.

When a device is provisioned with bidirectional attributes, the IoTAgent subscribes to changes in that attribute. When a
change notification for that attribute arrives to the IoTA, it applies the transformation defined in the device
provisioning payload to the notification, and calls the underlying notification handler with the transformed entity.

The following `attributes` section shows an example of the plugin configuration (using IOTA_AUTOCAST=false to avoid
translation from geo:point to geo:json)

```json
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name":"location",
          "type":"geo:point",
          "expression": "${@latitude}, ${@longitude}",
          "reverse": [
            {
              "object_id":"longitude",
              "type": "Text",
              "expression": "${trim(substr(@location, indexOf(@location, \",\") + 1, length(@location)))}"
            },
            {
              "object_id":"latitude",
              "type": "Text",
              "expression": "${trim(substr(@location, 0, indexOf(@location, \",\")))}"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
```

For each attribute that would have bidirectionality, a new field `reverse` must be configured. This field will contain
an array of fields that will be created based on the notifications content. The expression notification can contain any
attribute of the same entity as the bidirectional attribute; declaring them in the expressions will add them to the
subscription payload.

For each attribute in the `reverse` array, an expression must be defined to calculate its value based on the
notification attributes. This value will be passed to the underlying protocol with the `object_id` name. Details about
how the value is then progressed to the device are protocol-specific.

### Old IoTAgent data migration

In order to ease the transition from the old IoTAgent implementation (formerly known as IDAS) to the new Node.js based
implementations, a data migration tool has been developed. This data migration tool has been integrated as a command in
the IoTAgent command-line tester.

In order to perform a full migration, follow this steps:

-   From the project root, start the command-line tester:

```bash
    bin/iotAgentTester.js
```

-   Configure the MongoDB host and port, and the origin Database (that holds the data to be migrated):

```bash
    configMigration localhost 27017 originDB
```

-   Launch the migration, using the special value "\*" as service and subservice

```bash
    migrate targetDB * *
```

Some warnings may appear with the "Attribute [_id] was not found for item translation" message during the migration.
They show the values existing in the original DB that had no translation for the target DB.

If you want to restrict the migration for certain services and subservices, just substitute the `*` value for the
particular service and subservice you want to use.
